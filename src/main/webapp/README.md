- All tasks of project (default box 1)
- To Accept (default box 2)
- To restart (default box 3 if the user isn't a manager)

Rules
##
- Generic.
- No recursive function/method.
- Proper POO (private attribute, static method deprecated ...)
- Try catch only if necessary but checking with if statement is apreciated.
- JSON / no XML.
- Angular modular architecture.
- Respect Java layers.
